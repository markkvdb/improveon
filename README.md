Platform for connecting students with companies in the area around Groningen. Students can post tools that companies can buy for a small fee, whereas companies can post small project for students to work on. Students can apply for these projects, and the company will select a student for the job. 

An important part of the platform is the easy communication between students and companies. Students have a profile page, where they can list created tools and projects the student worked on.
